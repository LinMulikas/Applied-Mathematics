# Code

The special strign containing only 0, 1, but has the meaning of some actual character, which means there exist a injection map $f$, assume $S$ is the all the codes s.t.

$$f(x) = f(y) \implies x = y$$

And the continuous represente of code is easy to be ambiguous. Usually, we use the symbol $\gamma$ as the function.
