# Iteration Method

Considering a equation can be written in the form

$$ x = f(x) $$

One can create a iteration equation for $x$ by 

$$ x^{(k + 1)} = f(x^{(k)}) $$

But the convergence may be not ensured. If the limitation exists a [[Fixed Point]] $x^*$ such that

$$ \lim_{k \to \infty} x^{(k)} = x^* $$

We say the iteration method is convergent. Otherwise, we say it's divergent.
