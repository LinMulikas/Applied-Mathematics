# Minimum Spanning Tree

Considering there is a set of vertexes, $V = \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}$, we want build some edges connect them to be a [[Connected]], and the cost need to be minimal.

Usually, we considering a existing [[Weighted]] [[Graph]], and try to find a [[Tree]] as a [[Subgraph]], which requires to containing the whole $V$.
