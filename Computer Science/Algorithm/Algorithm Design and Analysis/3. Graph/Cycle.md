# Cycle

For a [[Path]] $P(v_1, v_k) = (v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k)$, if $v_1 = v_k$ in a [[Graph]], if there exists some $i, j$ with $i \ne j$ and $v_i, v_j \in P$. We say the [[Path]] contains a _cycle_.

And the [[Cycle]] is just the shortest path $P(v_i, v_j)$ with $v_i = v_j$. Generally, without description, we consider the $i \ne j$, which also means there is no self-cycle of a [[Vertex]].
