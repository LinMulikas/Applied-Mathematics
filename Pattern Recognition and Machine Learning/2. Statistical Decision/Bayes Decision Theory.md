# Bayes Decision Theory

When we know the [[Prior probability]], we want to find [[Posterior probability]] with some variable, then according to [[Bayes' Theorem]], we get 

$$ p(w | x) = \frac{p(x | w)p(w)}{p(x)} $$

where the $p(w)$ dependent on the [[Prior probability]], which is know, and we usually handle the $p(x)$ as known also.
