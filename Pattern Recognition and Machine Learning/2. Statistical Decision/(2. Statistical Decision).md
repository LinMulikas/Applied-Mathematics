# 2. Statistical Decision

# 2.1 Fundamentary
[[Bayes Decision Theory]] is usually called the _staticticla decision_. We use the notation $f$ as the model, and $f(x)$ of its prediction.

# 2.2 Minimize the Error

Usually, we try to minimize the expection of predict error

$$ \min \quad E[L(y, f(x))] $$

one can easily prove that minimize the error is equivalent to maximize the [[Posterior probability]].


# 2.3 Minimize the Risk

With the help of [[Loss Function]], [[Risk]] is defined as the expection on the sample space, which is impossible to calculate. Thus we define the [[Empirical Risk Minimization]] as the criterion of training our model.

To add some penalty to model, we define the [[Structural Risk Minimization]], which easily added some regularization penalty of our model.


# 2.4 Precise, ROC

For the prediction, the real label can be Positive, Negative. And our predict maybe True, False. Thus there are four type of results: TP, TN, FP, FN.

We define the following concepts

- [[Accuracy]].
- [[Recall]].
- [[Precision]].
- [[F-Score]].
