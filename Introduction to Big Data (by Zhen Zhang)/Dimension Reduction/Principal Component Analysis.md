# Principal Component Analysis

## Main idea

In every step, we find the vector represente the direction on which the maximum variance will be got after projection. We consider that this direction will retain the main property of our dataset. 

To calculate the direction clearly, we use the variance matrix show that difference of our data. Thus, the eigenvector with the maximum eigenvalue will be the direction.

Then, we find the second vector in the orthogonal hyper plane.
