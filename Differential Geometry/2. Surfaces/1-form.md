Assume $S$ is a [[Regular Surface]], the *1-form* of it is defined as
$$I(dr, dr) = dot(dr, dr)$$
use the bases in [[Tangent Space]], it can be written as
$$I = (du \space dv) \begin{pmatrix}
    E & F\\
    F & G\\
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
    du \\
    dv \\
\end{pmatrix}$$
one can check that, the $I$ is invariant under the change of bases.

Use the symbol $I(dr, \delta r)$, one can check that the
