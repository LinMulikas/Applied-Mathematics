Define the _2-form_ of a [[Regular Surface]] at $(u_0, v_0)$ as the inner-product
$$ dot(\delta r, n) = dot(d^2r, n) = dot(-dr, dn)$$

As the first order derivative are in the [[Tangent Space]], which is perpendicular to the normal vector.

The last equivalence comes from the truth that $dot(dr, n) = 0$, and calculate the total derivative.
